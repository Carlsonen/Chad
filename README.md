##Chad

ORE's new bot because maintaining the NodeJS variant just took too much effort. This thing though. I tell ya'. This thing is the OG of bots but only kinda sorta. Also, much like every other ORE project ever, this is still a work in progress. Check in three months after next Christmas for the next update.

If you're seeing this repository early on, take note that Nickster wrote most of it as his own introduction to Kotlin. So, if it looks ugly, go complain to Capo.

Run this by doing a good ol' `java -jar Chad-1.0.jar config.yml` with your own configuration (because duh).
